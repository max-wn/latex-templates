\section{Lists\label{List_examples}}

\subsection{Ordered list}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item item1
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item item1.1
        \end{enumerate}
    \item item2
    \item item3
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{An unordered list}
\begin{itemize}
    \item item1
        \begin{itemize}
            \item item1.1
        \end{itemize}
    \item item2
    \item item3
\end{itemize}

\section{Lables}
In section \ref{List_examples} I am talking about Lists. As
\textcite{example1} says, use bibliograpy in \LaTeX{}! And this is a reference
to ``Article'' : \textcite{example2}. Alsow see this book
\parencite{example3}. About picture, see \ref{Picture_example}.

\section{Formulas}
This is a formula: $2 + 2 = 4$.

This is an other formula:
\[2 + 2 = 4\]

These are formulas:
\[\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} = \sqrt{2 \pi}\]

\[x_n, x^k, x_n^k, x^k_n, x_{i + j}^{2022}\]

\[(x^i)^n\]

\[x^{i^n}\]
